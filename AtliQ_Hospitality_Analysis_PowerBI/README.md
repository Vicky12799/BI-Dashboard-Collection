# AtliQ Hospitality Analysis - PowerBI

**Overview:**

This project was part of the codebasics September month resume challenge. I used Power BI to analyze data from Atliq Grands, a chain of luxury hotels.

**Goals:**

- Provide data-driven insights to help Atliq Grands boost their market share and revenue.
- Create an easy-to-use Power BI dashboard for hotel data analysis.

**Key Features:**

- User-Friendly Dashboard: I built an interactive dashboard to explore hotel data, making it easy to understand. You can use features like bookmarks and tooltips for a better experience.

- Data Cleaning: I used Power Query and DAX to clean and organize the data, making sure it's accurate and reliable.

- Valuable Discoveries: The project revealed important findings, like Mumbai generating the most revenue, AtliQ Exotica's excellent performance, and the cost of cancellations.
